# MLChallenge

This challenge is about classifying a set of images into 7 emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral).
We need to implement our own model and train it on the dataset provided.
This project is available at the following link [MLChallenge](https://github.com/TARGAZ/MLChallenge).

## Project structure

- `images_notebook.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing the code which take the images as input and output the predicted emotions with a CNN model.
- `landmarks_notebook.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing the code which take the landmarks as input and output the predicted emotions with a SVM model.
- `svm_model.pkl` : SVM model saved with pickle.
- `cnn_model.pth` : CNN model saved with PyTorch.
- `result.csv` : CSV file containing the predictions of the CNN model on the final test set.
- `TAROT_POINGT_MONNIER_PLANCHENAULT.pdf` : PDF file containing the report of the project.
